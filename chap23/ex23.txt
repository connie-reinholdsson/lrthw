Read some code:
Read some code on Github and here are my observations:
- Many repositories split up their games into different modules and then 'require' the modules in the master file.
- Most repositories have a READ.ME document. This is where we describe the purpose of the repository / instructions to run the programme.
- .txt documents can be useful for storing information, or code which we won't want to run.
- .md documents are similar to text documents however the text can be formatted to e.g. bold, headers, table formatting, hyperlinks etc.
